		'DCMC - The hallmark of excellence'

Spanning over seven decades of long and rewarding history in the field of education behind us, our school community continues to move forward together with confidence, pride and enthusiasm in its Platinum Jubilee year!

Globalization demands a new dimension to our approach towards education wherein we have to recognize the need for a globally relevant education. Such an education would mean imparting knowledge that helps develop the skill set in students to confidently interact and work in diverse environs.

Easier said than done! And therefore we at DCMC are committed to provide a safe and intellectually challenging environment that will empower students to become innovative thinkers, creative problem solvers and inspired learners prepared to thrive in the times to come.

Students need both high challenge and high support to grow as learners and as schools we need to keep striving to maximize this growth to thne best of their ability. Give them courage, skills, optimism and integrity required to realize their dreams. Shape them into confident, creative and caring adults who pursue diverse, interesting and challenging careers.

To borrow John Hattie's words; "teachers should build classroom climates where errors are welcome, student engagement is the norm, questioning is high and students gain reputations as effective learners." May we all be blessed to realize this dream and keep going from strength to strength.

Best wishes
Ms. Yachana Chawla
